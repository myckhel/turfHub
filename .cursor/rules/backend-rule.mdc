## 🧱 Copilot Instruction Guide for Full-Stack (Laravel + Inertia.js + React + Zustand + TS + AntD + @gsap/react + Workbox pwa)

You are an expert senior fullstack developer working on **TurfMate**, a progressive web app for managing mini football turf sessions (match queueing, team creation, session management, payments).

## Backend

### Laravel

- **Eloquent ORM:**
  - Use `findOrFail()` or `firstOrFail()` to automatically handle "not found" scenarios.
  - Utilize Eager Loading (`with()`) to prevent N+1 query problems.
  - Define clear relationships in your models.
  - Use API Resources for transforming models and collections before sending them to the frontend, ensuring a consistent API structure.
- **Routing:** Group related routes and use route model binding. Name your routes for easier URL generation.
- **Form Requests:** Use Form Request classes for validation and authorization of incoming requests. This keeps controllers lean.
- **Services:** consider using Service classes for encapsulating domain-specific business logic. This promotes single responsibility and reusability.
- **Configuration:** Use .env files for environment-specific configuration and access them via the `config()` helper.
- **Eloquent Relationships & Query Scopes:** Use Eloquent relationships and query scopes for reusable queries.
- **Type Hinting & Return Types:** Use **type-hinting** and **return types** in all methods.
- **Utilizing Observers and Events:** Leverage Laravel's model observers and events when needed for handling actions that require another action to be taken in another context.
- **Utilize Model Observers:** Use model observers for handling post actions to be done after a model is created, updated, or deleted.
- **Avoid unnecessary patterns** Avoid returning response()->json() in controllers, 'status' = true and 'message' in responses and avoid inline class imports like `App\Http\Controllers\Api\BankAccountController` instead of `BankAccountController`.

### Laravel + API + Inertia.js Data Provider Logic

To reuse data provider logic effectively in a Laravel and Inertia.js application, ensuring the same data can be served to both your Inertia frontend and other platforms (like mobile apps via APIs), consider the following best practices:

1.  **Service/Action Classes for Business Logic:**

    - Encapsulate your core data retrieval and business logic within dedicated Service or Action classes. These classes will be responsible for fetching and processing data, independent of how it's presented (HTML via Inertia or JSON via API).
    - Your Laravel controllers (both for Inertia and API) will then call these services/actions to get the data. This keeps your controllers lean and promotes the Single Responsibility Principle.

2.  **Laravel API Resources for Data Transformation:**

    - Utilize Laravel API Resources to transform your Eloquent models and collections into the desired output structure.
    - These resources can be used by both your Inertia controllers (to prepare props) and your API controllers (to generate JSON responses). This ensures a consistent data structure across all consumers.
    - You can conditionally include data or relationships within your API Resources based on the request or context if needed.

3.  **Reusable Form Request Validation:**
    - Use Form Request classes for validating incoming data. These can be type-hinted in both your Inertia and API controller methods, ensuring consistent validation rules are applied regardless of the entry point.

**Example Workflow:**

- **Data Logic:** A `ProductService` might have a method `getActiveProducts()` that fetches all active products with their necessary relationships.
- **Transformation:** A `ProductResource` transforms a `Product` model into a structured array/JSON.
- **API Controller:**

  ```php
  // filepath: app/Http/Controllers/Api/ProductController.php
  use App\Http\Resources\ProductResource;
  use App\Services\ProductService;
  use Illuminate\Http\Resources\Json\AnonymousResourceCollection;

  class ProductController extends Controller
  {
      protected ProductService $productService;

      public function __construct(ProductService $productService)
      {
          $this->productService = $productService;
      }

      public function index(): AnonymousResourceCollection
      {
          $products = $this->productService->getActiveProducts();
          return ProductResource::collection($products);
      }
  }
  ```
