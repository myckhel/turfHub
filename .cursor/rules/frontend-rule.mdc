🧩 Interaction Patterns:

- Reuse **pop-out menus, sliding drawers, dropdowns, and modals**
- Add **feedback states**: loading, success, error
- Resizable panels or collapsible menus (e.g., Team list, Player panel)

### Design Patterns

- **Card with Icons:** Cards with title or metas should have icons to represent the content visually.
- **Container/Presentational Components:** Separate logic (container) from UI (presentational) components. Container components handle data fetching and state management, while presentational components focus on rendering UI.
- **Optimize for Mobile:** Ensure components are responsive and touch-friendly.

### Inertia.js

- **Data Props:** Be selective about the data you pass from Laravel controllers to Inertia pages. Only pass what's necessary for the initial page load; every other data will be fetched independently.
- **`usePage` Hook:** Access shared data and props in your React components using the `usePage().props` hook.
- **Partial Reloads:** Utilize partial reloads (`only` and `except` options) to optimize data fetching when only a portion of the page's data needs to be updated.
- **`remember`:** Use Inertia's `remember` functionality for preserving component state across page visits, especially for form inputs or filters.
- **Error Handling:** Use Inertia's error handling (`$page.props.errors`) to display validation errors from Laravel.
- **Routing:** Use Inertia's `<Link>` component or `router.visit()` for client-side navigation.
- **Shared Props:** Use **shared props** for global data (e.g., user, flash messages).

### React

- **Functional Components & Hooks:** Embrace functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) for managing state and side effects.
- **Component Composition:** Break down UI into small, reusable components. Favor composition over inheritance.
- **Props:** Keep props minimal and clearly defined. Use TypeScript interfaces for prop types.
- **State Management:** For local component state, `useState` is often sufficient. For more complex, shared state, use Zustand.
- **Memoization & Performance:** Use `React.memo` for components and `useMemo`/`useCallback` for functions and values to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Component State Encapsulation:** Keep component state encapsulated. Avoid lifting state up unless necessary.
- **Sub Components:** Break down large components into smaller sub-components to improve readability and maintainability in the same file that doesnt need to have its component in a separate file.
  example:

```tsx
import { memo } from 'react';

interface ItemsProps {
  items: ItemProps[];
}

const ItemList = memo(({ items }: ItemsProps) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <Item key={item.id} item={item} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
});

interface ItemProps {
  item: { id: number; title: string; description: string };
}

const Item = memo(({ item }: ItemProps) => (
  <li>
    <h3>{item.title}</h3>
    <p>{item.description}</p>
  </li>
));
export default ItemList;
```

-- ** Subcomponents Resource Flex ** Subcomponents that accept a resource in props should also accept the resource id in case the resource is not available in the props, this will allow the component to fetch the resource data from the api module.

### File-Based API Module Pattern

- **Centralized API Functions:** All API requests must use dedicated API modules located in `/resources/js/apis/`. Never make direct `fetch()`, `axios()`, or similar calls in components or stores.
- **Module Structure:** Each API module should export functions for specific domain operations (e.g., `turfApi.searchTurfs()`, `userApi.updateProfile()`).

**Example API Module Structure:**

```typescript
// filepath: resources/js/apis/turf.ts
import api from './index';
import type { TurfSearchParams, TurfResponse, PaginatedResponse } from '@/types';

export const turfApi = {
  searchTurfs: (params: TurfSearchParams): Promise<PaginatedResponse<TurfResponse>> => api.get(route('api.turfs.search'), { params }),

  joinTurf: (turfId: number): Promise<{ success: boolean; message: string }> => api.post(route('api.turfs.join', { turf: turfId })),

  getTurfDetails: (turfId: number): Promise<TurfResponse> => api.get(route('api.turfs.show', { turf: turfId })),
};
```

**Usage in Components:**

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - Using API module
import { turfApi } from '@/apis/turf';

const handleJoinTurf = async (turfId: number) => {
  try {
    const result = await turfApi.joinTurf(turfId);
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

**Integration with Zustand:** API modules should be used within Zustand store actions to maintain consistency and enable proper error handling and state updates.

### TypeScript

- **Strong Typing:** Strive for strong typing everywhere. Avoid `any` as much as possible. Use specific types for props, state, API responses, and function signatures.
- **Interfaces vs. Types:** Use `interface` for defining the shape of objects and `type` for unions, intersections, or more complex type aliases.
- **Utility Types:** Leverage built-in utility types like `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, `Omit` to create new types from existing ones.
- **Generics:** Use generics to create reusable components and functions that can work with a variety of types.

### Zustand

- **Modular Stores:** Create small, focused stores for different domains of your application state.
- **Selectors:** Use selectors (functions that derive data from the store state) to access and compute derived state in your components. This helps in optimizing re-renders.
- **Middleware:** Utilize Zustand middleware (e.g., `persist` for local storage, `devtools` for Redux DevTools integration, `immer` for immutable state updates) as needed.
- **Actions:** Define actions as functions within your store that encapsulate state update logic.
- **Features State** Define feature-specific state slices within your Zustand store. For example, have a `matchSessionStore` for match session-related state and actions.

### Laravel Inertia Ziggy Navigation

- **Use `route(routeName)` instead of hardcoded paths**
- **Prefer named routes in Laravel**
- **Ensure all navigable routes are named in Laravel**
- **Type-safe route parameters with Ziggy + TypeScript**

```tsx
route('user.profile', { id: user.id });
```

- **Avoid dynamic string route names**

* Don't do: `route('user.' + action)`
* Instead, use enums or clear constants.

- **Don’t mix Laravel redirects with Inertia navigation**
- - Use Inertia’s `<Link />` or `router.visit()` instead of `<a href>`.
- **Leverage `route().current()` to highlight active links**
- **Use `route().has()` to check if route exists before navigating**

### Ant Design

- **Theme Customization:** Use Ant Design's theming capabilities (e.g., via `ConfigProvider` or by customizing Less variables if you've set up Less) to match your application's branding.
- **Ant Design components:** restyled to match Discord’s theme
- **Form Handling:** Leverage Ant Design's `Form` component for robust form handling, validation, and layout.
- **Accessibility:** Pay attention to Ant Design's accessibility features and ensure your usage aligns with WCAG guidelines.
- **Responsive Design:** Use Ant Design's grid and responsive utilities to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.

### TailwindCSS

- **Avoid custom CSS:** Rely on Tailwind's utility classes instead of writing custom CSS whenever possible. This keeps your styles consistent and easier to maintain.
- **Utility-First:** Embrace the utility-first approach. Apply small, single-purpose classes directly in your HTML/JSX.
- **`@apply` Sparingly:** Use `@apply` in CSS/SCSS files for component-level abstractions or to group common utility patterns, but avoid overusing it, as it can negate some benefits of utility-first.
- **Configuration:** Customize your `tailwind.config.ts` to define your project's design system (colors, spacing, fonts, etc.).
- **Readability:** For very long lists of utility classes, consider breaking components down further or using conditional class helpers to improve readability.
- **Responsive Design:** Use Tailwind's responsive utilities to create mobile-first designs. Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, etc., to apply styles at different breakpoints.
- **Dark Mode:** Use Tailwind's dark mode utilities to support dark mode. Ensure your design is accessible in both light and dark themes.

### @gsap/react

- **`useGSAP` Hook:** Always use the `useGSAP` hook for animations. It automatically handles cleanup, preventing memory leaks when components unmount.
- **Scope:** Use the `scope` property within `useGSAP` to target elements within your component without needing to create `useRef` for every single element. This is cleaner and more efficient.
- **`gsap.context()`:** For more complex scenarios or when not in a React component, `gsap.context()` provides a similar cleanup functionality to `useGSAP`.
- **Timeline:** Use `gsap.timeline()` for sequencing animations. It gives you precise control over the order and timing of animations.
- **Performance:** For animations on many elements, use `gsap.fromTo()` and consider using `gsap.quickSetter()` for performance-critical animations that update frequently (e.g., on mouse move). Avoid animating properties that cause layout reflows (like `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`) and prefer `transform` and `opacity`.
- **SSR:** Be mindful of Server-Side Rendering. GSAP is a client-side library, so ensure your GSAP-related code only runs on the client, for example by using `useEffect` or `useGSAP`.

### Workbox PWA

- **Vite PWA Plugin:** In a Vite project, use the `vite-plugin-pwa` to simplify Workbox integration.
- **Caching Strategies:**
  - `StaleWhileRevalidate`: Good for assets that can be a bit stale but should be fast to load, like user avatars or API responses that don't need to be real-time.
  - `CacheFirst`: Best for assets that never change, like fonts, logos, or versioned static assets.
  - `NetworkFirst`: For requests where having the most up-to-date data is crucial, like fetching an article's content.
  - `NetworkOnly`: For requests that should never be cached, like payment transactions.
- **Background Sync:** Use Workbox's `BackgroundSyncPlugin` to queue failed network requests (e.g., form submissions) and retry them when the network is available.
- **Precaching:** Precache your app shell (the minimal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required to power the user interface) so the app loads reliably and instantly on subsequent visits.
- **Service Worker Lifecycle:** Understand the service worker lifecycle (`install`, `activate`, `fetch`). Use `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` carefully to ensure new service workers activate quickly, but be aware of the implications for open tabs.

### date-fns

- **Clarity:** Prefer `date-fns` over the native `Date` object for more readable and less error-prone date manipulations.
- **Time Zones:** Be cautious with time zones; use libraries like `date-fns-tz` for handling time zones correctly if needed.
- **Format & Parse:** Prefer **format** and **parse** for date display and input.

### Code Style and Consistency

- **ESLint/Prettier**: Enforce code style using ESLint and Prettier. Configure them to work together.
- **Comments**: Write clear and concise comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself. Abstract reusable logic into functions, hooks, or components.
- **Add new Exposed Api Postman Doc** Document any new API endpoints or changes to existing ones in the postman Api collection file.
- **Page Naming Conventions**: follow Index, Show, Edit, Create conventions.

### Artisan CLI

- **Built-in Commands:** Familiarize yourself with common Artisan commands for tasks like migrations (`migrate`), seeding (`db:seed`), route listing (`route:list`), and generating boilerplate (`make:model`, `make:controller`, `make:migration`, etc.).
- **Custom Commands:** Create custom Artisan commands for repetitive tasks or application-specific operations. This improves developer efficiency and automates workflows.
- **Scheduling:** Use Laravel's Task Scheduling to run Artisan commands or other tasks periodically.

## Yarn (Berry)

- Run scripts with `yarn <script>`.
- Use `yarn dlx` for one-off tools.

### ⚛️ Inertia.js + React 📁 **Structure**

```plaintext
resources/
├─ js/
│  ├─ components/
│  ├─ css/
│  ├─ layouts/
│  ├─ pages/
│  ├─ stores/ ← Zustand logic
│  ├─ hooks/
│  ├─ types/
│  └─ utils/
```

**General Tips:**

- Prioritize fetching data independently in components than relying on Laravel to pass all data through Inertia props.
- Write **unit and feature tests** for both backend and frontend.
- Use **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code consistency.
- Document components and APIs with **JSDoc** or PHPDoc.
- Use **GitHub Actions** or similar for CI/CD.
- Put theme mode into consideration and mobile friendliness for frontend ui/ux.
- Api documentation exists in the Postman collection file, ensure to check it when there is a need to call an API endpoint.
- write short code as possible, utilize short hand functions, avoid long lines of code, and use helper functions to break down complex logic.
- Avoid passing data with services on inertia pages controllers except for binded route resources, instead use api modules to fetch data in the components.
- Avoid generating useless files, components, or code that is not needed.

## Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
6. Be security concious. put security into consideration by making sure written codes follows security best practices. make sure there are no sensitive information in the front and and there are no vulnerabilities that can be exploited
